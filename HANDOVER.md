## Project Overview

### Concept and Vision
The Board of Life is an innovative life management system designed to help individuals manage their lives with the same strategic approach that a CEO uses to manage a company. The system provides a unified platform for tracking goals, tasks, metrics, and relationships across all aspects of life, supported by AI-driven insights and forecasting.

### Key Features
- Unified data model for all life aspects
- Strategic relationship mapping
- AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Comprehensive progress tracking
- Flexible and extensible architecture

## System Architecture

## Key Decisions

1. **Data Model Design**
   - Chose unified entries table for flexibility
   - Implemented versioning at the data level
   - Used JSONB for metadata storage

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected Sequelize for ORM
   - Chose PostgreSQL for JSONB support
   - Implemented Jest for testing

3. **Architecture**
   - Modular design for scalability
   - Separation of concerns
   - API-first approach

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - Bulk operations need optimization
   - Large dataset queries can be slow

2. **Security**
   - Authentication needs enhancement
   - Data encryption not fully implemented

3. **Testing**
   - Edge cases in relationship management
   - Performance tests need expansion

## Future Considerations

1. **AI Integration**
   - Daily snapshot generation
   - Predictive analytics
   - Recommendation engine

2. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard development
   - Visualization tools
   - Mobile interface

3. **Ecosystem Expansion**
   - Calendar integration
   - Wearable device support
   - Third-party API integration
